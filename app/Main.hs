-- | Generate all the files needed for the RealDice package

-- |  Data generated for use within the RealDice library is written to the
-- | `src/` directory in `.hs` files to avoid having to read the data from
-- | files at runtime

-- | One such file is list of integers that are pseudo-randomized with `StdGen`
-- | to use as a seed for the balanced data

-- | The other file contains the balanced data tables that are used in the
-- | random generation functions

-- | These files are set up to be generated so that I can easily add newly
-- | gathered data, process it, make sure that the pseudo-randomized lists are
-- | the correct length, and then automatically update all the parts of the
-- | library that use this data.

-- | In addition to these files, files with binary and CSV data are generated
-- | in the `generate-data/` directory for use outside of the RealDice library

-- | In the future, functionality will be added to check for valid seed files
-- | in the `data-seed/` directory. If such data is found it will be randomized
-- | with the RealDice data to produce custotom data files in the
-- | `generate-data/` directory

-- | If you would like to do this yourself now, it can be accomplished by using
-- | the `RealDice.Manipulate.Randomize` module to randomize the seed data and
-- | then use thing `RealDice.Convert.CSV` module to convert the randomized
-- | data to CSV format to write to a file
